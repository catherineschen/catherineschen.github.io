  <p>
    I am a fourth year PhD Candidate at Brown University working with Carsten Eickhoff in the 
    <a href="https://health-nlp.com/" target="_blank">Health NLP Lab</a>.
    Recently, I spent Spring 2025 as a visiting researcher in the <a href="https://irlab.science.uva.nl/">IRLab </a>
    at the University of Amsterdam, hosted by Maarten de Rijke.
  </p>

  <p>
    My research centers on explainable information retrieval (XIR), particularly developing methods 
    for interpretable and explainable search. I am also broadly interested in the interpretability of LLMs 
    and the applications of ML/NLP/IR to the biomedical domain. Overall, my work aims to bridge the 
    gap between model transparency and practical deployment, contributing to the development of more 
    accountable and trustworthy AI systems.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Previously, I worked as a full-stack software engineer for FreeWheel in NYC to develop advertising technology solutions. 
    I received my BA in Computer Science and French from Wellesley College, where I was also a member of the Track & Field 
    and Swimming & Diving Teams.
  </p>

  <p>
    In my spare time, I enjoy running, ice skating, cooking, and exploring local restaurants/bars.
